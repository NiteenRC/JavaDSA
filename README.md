# Java Programming Tasks

This repository contains solutions to various Java programming tasks.

1. **LRU cache implementation**: Implementation of an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache using doubly linked lists. Doubly linked lists are used for efficient removal and reinsertion of elements when they are accessed.

   [Solution](https://github.com/NiteenRC/JavaDSA/blob/master/src/main/java/cache/LRUCacheImpl.java)

2. **Search in a rotated sorted array**: Solution to the problem of searching in a rotated sorted array.

3. **Cron job to message friends every Friday of the last week of the month**: Implementation of a cron job to send messages to friends every Friday of the last week of the month.

   [Solution](https://github.com/NiteenRC/JavaDSA/blob/master/src/main/java/date/LastFridayOfMonth.java)

4. **Sort students by total marks**: Program to sort students by their total marks in descending order and print the sorted list of students with their respective total marks.

   [Solution](https://github.com/NiteenRC/JavaDSA/blob/master/src/main/java/sorting/SortStudentsByMarks.java)

5. **Find maximum average of students**: Given an array of students and their marks in different subjects, find the maximum average of the student.

   [Solution](https://github.com/NiteenRC/JavaDSA/blob/master/src/main/java/freq/StudentMaxMarksAvg.java)

6. **Remove duplicates from sorted array**: Given an integer array sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once.

   [Solution](https://github.com/NiteenRC/JavaDSA/blob/master/src/main/java/duplicate/RemoveDuplicates.java)

7. **Sort characters by frequency**: Sort the characters in a string by their frequency in descending order.
